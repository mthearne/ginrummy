# Event Handler Analysis Plan

## Overview
This document provides a systematic plan to analyze all event handlers in the EventSourcingEngine to understand their current implementation, identify issues, and plan improvements.

## Analysis Scope

### Current Handler Implementation Status
- **18 Implemented Handlers** - Need detailed analysis
- **12 Missing Handlers** - Need implementation planning  
- **1 Critical Gap** - ROUND_ENDED handler missing despite full event definition

## Analysis Framework

### For Each Implemented Handler, Analyze:

#### 1. **Functional Correctness**
- Does the handler correctly apply the event to game state?
- Are all required state transitions handled?
- Does it maintain game state consistency?
- Are edge cases properly handled?

#### 2. **State Management**
- What specific game state properties are modified?
- Are player states updated correctly?
- Is game phase management consistent?
- Are computed properties (deadwood, melds) recalculated when needed?

#### 3. **Business Logic Compliance**
- Does the handler follow Gin Rummy rules correctly?
- Are scoring calculations accurate?
- Are game flow transitions logical?
- Does it handle both PvP and PvE scenarios?

#### 4. **Error Handling**
- What validation is performed on event data?
- How are missing or invalid players handled?
- Are malformed events handled gracefully?
- Is there proper logging for debugging?

#### 5. **Performance & Efficiency**
- Are expensive operations (meld calculation) optimized?
- Is unnecessary work avoided?
- Are state updates minimal and targeted?

#### 6. **Integration Issues**
- How does it interact with other handlers?
- Are dependencies between events handled correctly?
- Does it prepare state properly for subsequent events?
